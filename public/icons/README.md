# Extension Icons

You need to create three icon files for your browser extension:

1. **icon-16.png** - 16x16 pixels (for the extension toolbar)
2. **icon-48.png** - 48x48 pixels (for the extension management page)
3. **icon-128.png** - 128x128 pixels (for the Chrome Web Store)

## How to create icons:

1. **Design**: Create a simple, recognizable icon that represents your new tab page
   - Recommended: A stylized tab symbol, clock, or abstract geometric shape
   - Use a color scheme that matches your extension (purple/indigo theme would work well)

2. **Tools**: You can use:
   - Online tools like Canva, Figma, or Photopea
   - Free icon generators like favicon.io
   - AI tools like DALL-E or Midjourney

3. **Requirements**:
   - PNG format
   - Square aspect ratio
   - High contrast and clear at small sizes
   - Consistent design across all sizes

4. **Quick option**:
   - Visit https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
   - Enter "NT" (for New Tab) with a purple background
   - Download and rename the files appropriately

## Temporary placeholders:

The current manifest.json references these icons, but they don't exist yet.
The extension will still work without icons, but proper icons improve the user experience.
